# E-Commerce-Fraud-Detection-using-Python
## Overview
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions in e-commerce datasets using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The aim is to develop a robust fraud detection model that minimizes false positives while maintaining high accuracy, ensuring a secure and trustworthy shopping experience for users.

## Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data to prepare a high-quality dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed detailed analysis to uncover trends, anomalies, and patterns associated with fraudulent activities.
Feature Engineering: Created new variables to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Development: Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and selected the best-performing algorithm based on evaluation metrics.
Fraud Detection Metrics: Emphasized precision, recall, and F1 score to balance the trade-off between identifying fraudulent transactions and avoiding false alarms.
Visualization: Provided insightful visualizations to explain model performance and fraud trends.
Deployment Readiness: Prepared the solution for scalability and integration with real-time fraud detection systems.
## Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Machine Learning: Supervised learning models for binary classification
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for exploratory and result visualization
